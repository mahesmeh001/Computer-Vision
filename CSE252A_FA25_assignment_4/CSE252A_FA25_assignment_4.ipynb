To capture this information, we use the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), a standard technique that represents an image block in terms of spatial patterns of varying frequencies (basis functions). If interested in learning more, see [CSE 166: Image Processing (Fall 2023)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse166-a/) lecture [Basis vectors, basis images, and matrix-based transforms](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse166-a/lec10.pdf).\n",

This results in 8x8, i.e., 64 DCT coefficient values. Now, from each block, we select the indices of the basis functions with the largest magnitudes (top 2 in this case), excluding the DC term that represents the average intensity. These indices will serve as the features of the local texture. All of this preprocessing has already been done for you, and you are given only the resulting feature vectors from the foreground and background regions, along with the feature vectors for every pixel in the test image.\n",
