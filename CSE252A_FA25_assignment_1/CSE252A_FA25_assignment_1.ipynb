Additionally, you will implement the specular removal technique of [Mallick et al.](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~zickler/download/photodiff_cvpr05_preprint.pdf), which enables photometric stereo to be performed on certain non-Lambertian materials.\n",

Note that for good results you will often want to run the `horn_integrate` function with 10000-100000 iterations, which will take a while. For your final submission, we will require that you run Horn integration for 10000 (ten thousand) iterations or more in each case.
